Welcome to my solar system program !

First of all, for it to work, you'll need to :
1. Have python on your PC
2. Have pygame : pip install pygame
3. To run it, just do : python run.py

You'll find 3 apps :

Telescope :
  This app's goal is for you to see the solar system the more realistically possible. To do so, you can change the rotation speed or some other parameters.
 
Planet Maps:
  This app is for simulating the time it would take for you to go from one planet to another, simply by clicking on the planets.
 
Gravity Jump:
  You'll just need to click on a planet to activate a small simulation of what a regular jump would look like in any planet you'd like, with their gravity.
