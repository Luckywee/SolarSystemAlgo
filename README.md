# Welcome to my solar system program !

#### Required installs to make it work :

1. Install python on your PC
2. Install libraries with pip :
   1. `pip install requests`
   2. If you have python version under 3.11 (`py -V` to check the version), do the ***a*** step, if you have 3.11, do the ***b*** step.

You'll find 3 apps :

#### Telescope :

This app's goal is for you to see the solar system the more realistically possible. To do so, you can change the rotation speed or some other parameters.

#### Planet Maps:

This app is for simulating the time it would take for you to go from one planet to another, simply by clicking on the planets.

#### Gravity Jump:

You'll just need to click on a planet to activate a small simulation of what a regular jump (0.5m) would look like in any planet you'd like, with their gravity.
